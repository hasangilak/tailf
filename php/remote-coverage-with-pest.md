# Remote API Coverage Testing with Pest PHP: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Usual unit tests run code directly in the testing environment, making code coverage collection straightforward. But what happens when you need to test APIs through actual HTTP requests? How do you measure code coverage when your tests make real network calls to your application?

This guide explores an innovative approach to collecting code coverage data from remote API calls using Pest PHP, XDebug, and dynamic wrapper generation.

## The Challenge

When testing APIs through HTTP requests, standard code coverage tools face a fundamental limitation:

- **Unit tests**: Execute code directly, coverage tools can track execution
- **API tests**: Make HTTP requests to a separate process, coverage tracking is lost

This gap means teams often have comprehensive API tests but no visibility into which code paths those tests actually exercise.

## The Solution: Coverage Middleware

Our approach uses middleware that:

1. Intercepts HTTP requests during testing
2. Enables XDebug coverage collection
3. Executes the original API code
4. Saves coverage data for later analysis

Here's the conceptual flow:

```
Test Request → Coverage Middleware → XDebug Start → API Code → XDebug Stop → Save Data
```

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Coverage Functions Library**
   - Manages XDebug coverage collection
   - Filters and saves coverage data
   - Generates consolidated reports

2. **Coverage Middleware**
   - Intercepts requests when coverage headers are present
   - Starts and stops XDebug coverage collection
   - Handles coverage data persistence

3. **API Test Helper**
   - Detects coverage mode via headers
   - Configures middleware stack
   - Collects coverage data per test

### How It Works

#### Step 1: Test Initialization

When a test runs with coverage enabled, the system:

```php
// Test sends coverage headers
$headers = [
    'X-Coverage-Enabled' => '1',
    'X-Coverage-Test-Name' => 'login-valid-credentials'
];
```

#### Step 2: Middleware Registration

The coverage middleware is registered in the application:

```php
// Register middleware in your application bootstrap
$app->middleware(function ($request, $next) {
    if ($request->hasHeader('X-Coverage-Enabled')) {
        $coverage = startCoverageCollection();
        $response = $next($request);
        stopAndSaveCoverage($coverage, $request->getHeader('X-Coverage-Test-Name'));
        return $response;
    }
    return $next($request);
});
```

#### Step 3: Request Processing

Test requests flow through the normal application routing with middleware:

```php
// Request: POST /api/users/login
// Flow: Request → Coverage Middleware → Controller → Response
```

#### Step 4: Coverage Collection

XDebug tracks execution within the middleware's scope:

```php
function startCoverageCollection() {
    xdebug_start_code_coverage(XDEBUG_CC_UNUSED | XDEBUG_CC_DEAD_CODE);
    return ['started_at' => microtime(true)];
}

function stopAndSaveCoverage($state, $testName) {
    $data = xdebug_get_code_coverage();
    xdebug_stop_code_coverage();
    // Save coverage data to JSON with test name
    saveCoverageData($testName, $data);
}
```

#### Step 5: Report Generation

After tests complete, coverage data is merged and analyzed:

```php
function generateCoverageReport() {
    // Merge all test coverage data
    // Calculate line and file coverage
    // Generate HTML and text reports
}
```

## Practical Implementation

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Required extensions
- PHP with XDebug
- XDebug coverage mode enabled
- Write permissions for temporary files
```

### 2. Test Structure

```php
describe('User Authentication API', function () {
    beforeEach(function () {
        $this->api = new ApiCaller();
        $this->api->setCoverageEnabled(true);
    });
    
    it('accepts valid credentials', function () {
        $this->api->setCoverageTestName('login-valid');
        
        $response = $this->api->post('/users/login', [
            'username' => 'testuser',
            'password' => 'testpass'
        ]);
        
        expect($response)->toHaveStatus(200);
    });
});
```

### 3. Coverage Collection Flow

```
1. Test starts → Coverage enabled check
2. Middleware detects coverage headers
3. HTTP request processed normally
4. XDebug collects execution data
5. Coverage data saved to file
6. Response returned to test
7. Reports generated from all data
```

## Advanced Features

### Filtering Coverage Data

Only track relevant application code:

```php
foreach ($coverageData as $file => $lines) {
    if (strpos($file, '/vendor/') !== false) continue;
    if (strpos($file, '/tests/') !== false) continue;
    // Process application files only
}
```

### Multiple Test Scenarios

Track coverage across different test cases:

```json
{
    "test_name": "login-invalid-password",
    "coverage_data": {
        "/api/users/login.php": {
            "15": 1,  // Line executed
            "16": 1,
            "17": -1, // Line not executed
            "18": 1
        }
    }
}
```

### Merged Coverage Reports

Combine data from all tests:

```
Overall Coverage: 87.5%
- /api/users/login.php: 90% (18/20 lines)
- /api/users/profile.php: 85% (17/20 lines)
```

## Benefits

1. **Real HTTP Testing**: Test actual API behavior, not mocked responses
2. **Accurate Coverage**: Know exactly which code paths your API tests cover
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Generate coverage reports in automated pipelines
4. **Gap Analysis**: Identify untested error paths and edge cases
5. **Quality Metrics**: Track coverage trends over time

## Best Practices

### 1. Selective Coverage

Enable coverage only when needed:

```php
if (getenv('COVERAGE') === '1') {
    $this->enableCoverage();
}
```

### 2. Middleware Configuration

Configure middleware for test environments only:

```php
if (app()->environment('testing')) {
    app()->middleware(CoverageMiddleware::class);
}
```

### 3. Performance Considerations

- Coverage collection adds overhead
- Run coverage builds separately from regular tests
- Consider conditional middleware loading

### 4. Security

- Never enable coverage middleware in production
- Restrict coverage headers to test environments
- Validate coverage headers aren't exposed publicly

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Issue: Permission Denied

```bash
# Solution: Ensure write permissions
chmod 777 coverage-data/
```

### Issue: XDebug Not Available

```php
// Check before starting
if (!extension_loaded('xdebug')) {
    $this->skipCoverage();
}
```

### Issue: Memory Limits

```ini
; Increase limits for coverage
memory_limit = 512M
xdebug.var_display_max_depth = 10
```

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
- name: Run API Tests with Coverage
  run: |
    XDEBUG_MODE=coverage COVERAGE=1 vendor/bin/pest
    
- name: Upload Coverage Report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: coverage-report
    path: coverage-html/
```

### Coverage Badges

Generate and display coverage percentages:

```markdown
![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-87%25-brightgreen)
```

## Conclusion

Remote API coverage testing bridges the gap between comprehensive API testing and code coverage visibility. By leveraging middleware architecture and XDebug's coverage capabilities, teams can:

- Measure true API test effectiveness
- Identify untested code paths
- Maintain high-quality API implementations
- Make data-driven testing decisions

This approach transforms API testing from a black-box activity into a transparent process with measurable outcomes.
